                Our project is to create an application where people from the same region can meet to perform sports activities. The sector where it develops is Sports and Fitness. The business model on which it is based is that of social networks, in the sense of connecting people, but in order to give greater accessibility to sport, removing obstacles to do so and socializing with sports people.

                Currently within the market there is no place to access to play sports with people we do not know but who feel the same passion for sports activities and have the same need to play sports with more people, but do not have contacts to do it . The possible success of our application is that it would offer the opportunity to cover this need that many people have covering different sports, such as running (going to run with more people and sharing experiences), soccer (creating games where players are missing and people can join these), calisthenics (test your skills, improve them and learn new things when training with people you do not know) ...
